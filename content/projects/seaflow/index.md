Since 2010, the shipboard underway cytometer SeaFlow has been operated for 788 days across 210,000 km of ocean, counting over 750 billion particles in surface waters. We have created reproducible analytical methods to uniformly process and curate SeaFlow data. The datasets consist of cell abundance, cell diameter and cellular carbon content of small phytoplankton (< 5 μm), which includes the cyanobacteria <i>Prochlorococcus</i>, <i>Synechococcus</i> and <i>Crocosphaera</i>, and unindentified protists.

* Datasets are available [here](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7102019) without restriction.

* Description of the SeaFlow data can be found in [Ribalet et al. 2019](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-019-0292-2).
