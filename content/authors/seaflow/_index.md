The SeaFlow instrument is a shipboard underway flow cytometer that provides continuous multi-parameter single particle measurements without the need for clean water. The instrument eliminates the traditional need for a sheath fluid by employing a unique optical system that relies on three photodetectors to create a virtual core in the sample stream within which the properties of particles are accurately measured. In this way, the instrument is able to collect the equivalent of 1 sample every 3 minutes or every 1 km (for a ship moving at 10 knots) from the ship’s flow-through seawater system. See [article](https://doi.org/10.4319/lom.2011.9.466) for more information.”

The SeaFlow instrument was developed by [Jarred Swalwell](https://armbrustlab.ocean.washington.edu/people/swalwell/) at the University of Washington, feel free to [contact him](mailto:jarred@uw.edu) with any questions related to the SeaFlow instrument and technologies.
