My research focuses on the essential role microbes play in marine ecosystems.
As a marine ecologist, I study how interactions between the diverse microbial communities - bacteria, phytoplankton, and the organisms that consume them - influence the health and stability of our oceans across scales, from the microscopic level to entire ocean basins. 
My approach is quantitative and interdisciplinary, combining mathematical modeling, simulations and statistical analysis to understand these processes and predict changes in the marine carbon cycle.
I also conduct fieldwork, using a specialized tool called SeaFlow - our shipboard underway flow cytometer - to collect the necessary data for model testing.
