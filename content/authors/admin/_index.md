My research focuses on developing a mechanistic understanding of marine ecosystem dynamics and the influence of biological activities on carbon cycling. 
I specialize in studying structure and interactions of microbial communities, including viruses, bacteria, phytoplankton, and grazers. 
These microorganisms play a crucial role in regulating the Earth's climate by fixing carbon dioxide into biomass, recycling nutrients, and forming the base of the marine food web. 
I develop mathematical and data-driven models, guided by lab experiments and field observations, to explore how these organisms interact with their environment  and regulate carbon fluxes in the surface ocean.
