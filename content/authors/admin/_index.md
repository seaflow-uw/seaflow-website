My research delves into the mechanics governing marine ecosystems and the critical role biological processes play in carbon cycling. 
As a marine ecologist, I specialize in studying microbial communities - including viruses, bacteria, phytoplankton, and grazers - across various spatial scales, from the microscopic to ocean basins. 
My approach is quantitative and interdisciplinary, blending mathematical and simulation modeling with statistical analysis of complex datasets. 
I conduct fieldwork - deploying SeaFlow, our shipboard underway flow cytometer - to collect the necessary data for testing theoretical models and enhancing our predictive understanding of the marine carbon cycle.
