I am a biological oceanographer working as a research scientist at the University of Washington. I study how microbial communities respond to environmental perturbations and ultimately how they will respond to future ocean conditions. My research approach uses [flow cytometry](https://seaflow.netlify.com/) observations collected from research vessels across ocean basins to build population models that predict cell, population and ecosystem interactions.
