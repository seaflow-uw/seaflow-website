As a biological oceanographer at the University of Washington, my research focuses on understanding the dynamics of marine ecosystems and the impact of biological processes on the cycling of nutrients and elements in the ocean. I specialize in studying the structure and interactions of microbial communities, such as viruses, bacteria, phytoplankton, and grazers. These microorganisms play a crucial role in regulating the Earth's climate by fixing carbon dioxide, generating biomass, recycling nutrients, and forming the foundation of the marine food web.
To achieve my research goals, you use laboratory experiments, field observations, and satellite data to develop mathematical models that predict how these organisms will interact under different ocean conditions. By studying these interactions, I hope to better understand how marine ecosystems will respond to future changes in ocean temperature, nutrients, and other environmental factors.
