Phytoplankton are the main focus of research in my lab. These organisms are responsible for about 50% of the total amount of photosynthesis that occurs on our planet. They play a critical role in the global carbon cycle and ultimately in global climate. Because much of the organic carbon generated by phytoplankton is used by bacteria and archaea, my group also studies phytoplankton interactions with other microbes.<br/>
