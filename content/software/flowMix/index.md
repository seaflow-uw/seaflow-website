Modeling cell populations measured by flow cytometry with covariates using sparse mixture of regressions.<br/>

In this project led by Dr. Sangwon Hyun, we apply a sparse mixture of multivariate regressions model for flow cytometry data. The main motivating application is continuous-time flow cytometry data collected in the ocean, over space and time. we propose a novel sparse mixture of multivariate regressions model to estimate the time-varying phytoplankton subpopulations while simultaneously identifying the specific environmental covariates that are predictive of the observed changes to these subpopulations. The software, called [flowMix](https://github.com/sangwon-hyun/flowmix) is available on GitHub.

A short vignette [here](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/sangwon-hyun/flowmix/blob/master/flowmix/vignettes/flowmix.html) shows how to use the package.
